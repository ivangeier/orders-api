## Description

**Project is under construction**

Orders API is a project designed to streamline order management processes within e-commerce platforms. Leveraging the power of Nest.js, RabbitMQ, and JWT token authentication, this project provides a secure, scalable, and efficient solution for handling all orders with utmost reliability.

1. Nest.js Framework: Built on top of Nest.js, a progressive Node.js framework, Orders API offers a solid foundation for building efficient, maintainable, and scalable server-side applications. Its modular architecture and dependency injection system simplify the development process, allowing for easy integration of various components.

2. RabbitMQ Integration: With RabbitMQ, a highly reliable message broker, Orders API ensures seamless communication between different parts of the application. Through asynchronous messaging patterns, orders are processed efficiently, enabling real-time updates and improved system responsiveness.

3. JWT Token Authentication: Security is paramount in e-commerce applications, and Orders API employs JWT token authentication to verify and authorize users accessing the system. By securely exchanging tokens between the client and server, only authenticated users can perform actions related to order management, safeguarding sensitive data and preventing

4. Scalable and Extensible Architecture: Designed with scalability and extensibility in mind, Orders API allows for effortless scaling to accommodate growing user demands. Its modular structure facilitates the addition of new features and integration with third-party services, empowering developers to adapt the system according to specific business requirements.unauthorized access.
